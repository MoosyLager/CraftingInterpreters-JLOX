# Crafting Interpreters Part One - jlox

## Author

Shenal Herath

## Description

This is the first part of the book designing an interpreter jlox written in Java to implement the _lox_ language.

This is my implementation after following the [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Robert Nystrom.
